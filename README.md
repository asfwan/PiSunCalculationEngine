## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>

This project aims to calculate PI value in increasing accuracy manner. The more the process is run, the value of PI is calculated more accurately.

## 🏁 Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

The project provides a web page to show:
1. PI Value (the value will be more accurate as you press on the 'Improve PI Value' button)
2. Sun circumference (the circumference is tied to the latest and most accurate value of PI)

### Prerequisites

To run this project in your computer, you need to have these software installed:
1. Docker (for mysql)
2. Nodejs (preferrably v16 - for client side and server side)

### Installing

Disclaimer:
You will see a docker-compose.yml that is still WIP. The script will not work yet.
You will also find and deployer_script.sh which is also WIP. The script is meant to ease deployment, but it does not work yet.

From here, we have to use quite manual steps to start-up the project.

Firstly, make sure you have docker installed and running.
Secondly, make sure that you can run npm commands from your preferred terminal.

So, let us begin.

Unzip the source code to a folder using an unzipper software.
